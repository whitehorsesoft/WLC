				<p><strong>Q. 71. How is justification an act of God’s free grace?</strong></p>

				<p><strong>Q. 72. What is justifying faith?</strong></p>

				<p><strong>Q. 73. How doth faith justify a sinner in the sight of God?</strong></p>

				<p><strong>Q. 74. What is adoption?</strong></p>

Sanctification is a work of God’s grace, whereby they whom God hath, before the foundation of the world, chosen to be holy, are in time, through the powerful operation of his Spirit<a name="fnB313" href="WLC_fn_051-090.html#fn313" target="footnotes">[314]</a> applying the death and resurrection of Christ unto them,<a name="fnB314" href="WLC_fn_051-090.html#fn314" target="footnotes">[315]</a> renewed in their whole man after the image of God;<a name="fnB315" href="WLC_fn_051-090.html#fn315" target="footnotes">[316]</a> having the seeds of repentance unto life, and all other saving graces, put into their hearts,<a name="fnB316" href="WLC_fn_051-090.html#fn316" target="footnotes">[317]</a> and those graces so stirred up, increased, and strengthened,<a name="fnB317" href="WLC_fn_051-090.html#fn317" target="footnotes">[318]</a> as that they more and more die unto sin, and rise unto newness of life.<a name="fnB318" href="WLC_fn_051-090.html#fn318" target="footnotes">[319]</a></p>
				<p><strong>Q. 76. What is repentance unto life?</strong></p>
				<p>A. Repentance unto life is a saving grace,<a name="fnB319" href="WLC_fn_051-090.html#fn319" target="footnotes">[320]</a> wrought in the heart of a sinner by the Spirit<a name="fnB320" href="WLC_fn_051-090.html#fn320" target="footnotes">[321]</a> and Word of God,<a name="fnB321" href="WLC_fn_051-090.html#fn321" target="footnotes">[322]</a> whereby, out of the sight and sense, not only of the danger,<a name="fnB322" href="WLC_fn_051-090.html#fn322" target="footnotes">[323]</a> but also of the filthiness and odiousness of his sins,<a name="fnB323" href="WLC_fn_051-090.html#fn323" target="footnotes">[324]</a> and upon the apprehension of God’s mercy in Christ to such as are penitent,<a name="fnB324" href="WLC_fn_051-090.html#fn324" target="footnotes">[325]</a> he so grieves for<a name="fnB325" href="WLC_fn_051-090.html#fn325" target="footnotes">[326]</a> and hates his sins,<a name="fnB326" href="WLC_fn_051-090.html#fn326" target="footnotes">[327]</a> as that he turns from them all to God,<a name="fnB327" href="WLC_fn_051-090.html#fn327" target="footnotes">[328]</a> purposing and endeavouring constantly to walk with him in all the ways of new obedience.<a name="fnB328" href="WLC_fn_051-090.html#fn328" target="footnotes">[329]</a></p>
				<p><strong>Q. 77. Wherein do justification and sanctification differ?</strong></p>
				<p>A. Although sanctification be inseparably joined with justification,<a name="fnB329" href="WLC_fn_051-090.html#fn329" target="footnotes">[330]</a> yet they differ, in that God in justification imputeth the righteousness of Christ;<a name="fnB330" href="WLC_fn_051-090.html#fn330" target="footnotes">[331]</a> in sanctification of his Spirit infuseth grace, and enableth to the exercise thereof;<a name="fnB331" href="WLC_fn_051-090.html#fn331" target="footnotes">[332]</a> in the former, sin is pardoned;<a name="fnB332" href="WLC_fn_051-090.html#fn332" target="footnotes">[333]</a> in the other, it is subdued:<a name="fnB333" href="WLC_fn_051-090.html#fn333" target="footnotes">[334]</a> the one doth equally free all believers from the revenging wrath of God, and that perfectly in this life, that they never fall into condemnation<a name="fnB334" href="WLC_fn_051-090.html#fn334" target="footnotes">[335]</a> the other is neither equal in all,<a name="fnB335" href="WLC_fn_051-090.html#fn335" target="footnotes">[336]</a> nor in this life perfect in any,<a name="fnB336" href="WLC_fn_051-090.html#fn336" target="footnotes">[337]</a> but growing up to perfection.<a name="fnB337" href="WLC_fn_051-090.html#fn337" target="footnotes">[338]</a></p>
				<p><strong>Q. 78. Whence ariseth the imperfection of sanctification in believers?</strong></p>
				<p>A. The imperfection of sanctification in believers ariseth from the remnants of sin abiding in every part of them, and the perpetual lustings of the flesh against the spirit; whereby they are often foiled with temptations, and fall into many sins,<a name="fnB338" href="WLC_fn_051-090.html#fn338" target="footnotes">[339]</a> are hindered in all their spiritual services,<a name="fnB339" href="WLC_fn_051-090.html#fn339" target="footnotes">[340]</a> and their best works are imperfect and defiled in the sight of God.<a name="fnB340" href="WLC_fn_051-090.html#fn340" target="footnotes">[341]</a></p>
				<p><strong>Q. 79. May not true believers, by reason of their imperfections, and the many temptations and sins they are overtaken with, fall away from the state of grace?</strong></p>

				<p><strong>Q. 80. Can true believers be infallibly assured that they are in the estate of grace, and that they shall persevere therein unto salvation?</strong></p>
				<p>A. Such as truly believe in Christ, and endeavour to walk in all good conscience before him,<a name="fnB348" href="WLC_fn_051-090.html#fn348" target="footnotes">[349]</a> may, without extraordinary revelation, by faith grounded upon the truth of God’s promises, and by the Spirit enabling them to discern in themselves those graces to which the promises of life are made,<a name="fnB349" href="WLC_fn_051-090.html#fn349" target="footnotes">[350]</a> and bearing witness with their spirits that they are the children of God,<a name="fnB350" href="WLC_fn_051-090.html#fn350" target="footnotes">[351]</a> be infallibly assured that they are in the estate of grace, and shall persevere therein unto salvation.<a name="fnB351" href="WLC_fn_051-090.html#fn351" target="footnotes">[352]</a></p>
				<p><strong>Q. 81. Are all true believers at all times assured of their present being in the estate of grace, and that they shall be saved?</strong></p>
				<p>A. Assurance of grace and salvation not being of the essence of faith,<a name="fnB352" href="WLC_fn_051-090.html#fn352" target="footnotes">[353]</a> true believers may wait long before they obtain it;<a name="fnB353" href="WLC_fn_051-090.html#fn353" target="footnotes">[354]</a> and, after the enjoyment thereof, may have it weakened and intermitted, through manifold distempers, sins, temptations, and desertions;<a name="fnB354" href="WLC_fn_051-090.html#fn354" target="footnotes">[355]</a> yet they are never left without such a presence and support of the Spirit of God as keeps them from sinking into utter despair.<a name="fnB355" href="WLC_fn_051-090.html#fn355" target="footnotes">[356]</a></p>

				<p><strong>Q. 83. What is the communion in glory with Christ which the members of the invisible church enjoy in this life?</strong></p>
				<p>A. The members of the invisible church have communicated to them in this life the firstfruits of glory with Christ, as they are members of him their head, and so in him are interested in that glory which he is fully possessed of;<a name="fnB359" href="WLC_fn_051-090.html#fn359" target="footnotes">[360]</a> and, as an earnest thereof, enjoy the sense of God’s love,<a name="fnB360" href="WLC_fn_051-090.html#fn360" target="footnotes">[361]</a> peace of conscience, joy in the Holy Ghost, and hope of glory;<a name="fnB361" href="WLC_fn_051-090.html#fn361" target="footnotes">[362]</a> as, on the contrary, sense of God’s revenging wrath, horror of conscience, and a fearful expectation of judgment, are to the wicked the beginning of their torments which they shall endure after death.<a name="fnB362" href="WLC_fn_051-090.html#fn362" target="footnotes">[363]</a></p>
				<p><strong>Q. 84. Shall all men die?</strong></p>

				<p><strong>Q. 85. Death, being the wages of sin, why are not the righteous delivered from death, seeing all their sins are forgiven in Christ?</strong></p>
				<p>A. The righteous shall be delivered from death itself at the last day, and even in death are delivered from the sting and curse of it;<a name="fnB366" href="WLC_fn_051-090.html#fn366" target="footnotes">[367]</a> so that, although they die, yet it is out of God’s love,<a name="fnB367" href="WLC_fn_051-090.html#fn367" target="footnotes">[368]</a> to free them perfectly from sin and misery,<a name="fnB368" href="WLC_fn_051-090.html#fn368" target="footnotes">[369]</a> and to make them capable of further communion with Christ in glory, which they then enter upon.<a name="fnB369" href="WLC_fn_051-090.html#fn369" target="footnotes">[370]</a></p>
				<p><strong>Q. 86. What is the communion in glory with Christ, which the members of the invisible church enjoy immediately after death?</strong></p>
