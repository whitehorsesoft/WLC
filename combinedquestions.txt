<p>A. The fourth commandment requireth of all men the sanctifying or keeping holy to God such set times as he hath appointed in his Word, expressly one whole day in seven; which was the seventh from the beginning of the world to the resurrection of Christ, and the first day of the week ever since, and so to continue to the end of the world; which is the Christian sabbath,<a name="fnB621" href="WLC_fn_091-150.html#fn621" target="footnotes">[622]</a> and in the New Testament called <em>The Lord’s day</em>.<a name="fnB622" href="WLC_fn_091-150.html#fn622" target="footnotes">[623]</a></p>

<p><strong>Q. 118. Why is the charge of keeping the sabbath more specially directed to governors of families, and other superiors?</strong></p>
<p>A. The charge of keeping the sabbath is more specially directed to governors of families, and other superiors, because they are bound not only to keep it themselves, but to see that it be observed by all those that are under their charge; and because they are prone ofttimes to hinder them by employments of their own.<a name="fnB628" href="WLC_fn_091-150.html#fn628" target="footnotes">[629]</a></p>

<p><strong>Q. 120. What are the reasons annexed to the fourth commandment, the more to enforce it?</strong></p>
<p>A.
